/**
 * Throw exception or error
 *
 * Format:
 *   athrow
 *
 * Forms:
 *   athrow = 147 (0x93)
 *
 * Stack:
 *   ..., objectref -> objectref
 *
 * Description:
 *
 *   The objectref must be of type reference and must refer to an object
 *   that is an instance of class Throwable or of a subclass of Throwable.
 *   It is popped from the operand stack. The objectref is then thrown by
 *   searching the current frame (ยง3.5 Frames) for the most recent catch
 *   clause that catches the class of objectref or one of its superclasses.
 *
 *   If a catch clause is found, it contains the location of the code
 *   intended to handle this exception. The pc register is reset to that
 *   location, the operand stack of the current frame is cleared, objectref
 *   is pushed back onto the operand stack, and execution continues. If no
 *   appropriate clause is found in the current frame, that frame is popped,
 *   the frame of its invoker is reinstated, and the objectref is rethrown.
 *
 *   If no catch clause is found that handles this exception, the virtual
 *   machine exits.
 *
 * Runtime Exception:
 *
 *   If objectref is null, athrow throws a NullPointerException instead of
 *   objectref.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *   In some circumstances, the athrow instruction may throw a
 *   SecurityException if the current context (ยง3.4 Contexts) is not the
 *   owning context (ยง3.4 Contexts) of the object referenced by objectref.
 *   The exact circumstances when the exception will be thrown are specified
 *   in Chapter 6 of the Runtime Environment Specification, Java Card 3
 *   Platform, v3.0.5, Classic Edition.
